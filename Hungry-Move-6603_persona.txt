---- BASIC NLP-BASED TRAITS ----

Interests: Technology, Finance, Fitness, Food, Travel
Evidence: Technology: Everyone is something in LKO. Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes. I have hardly seen a car which does not have a sticker on it - everyone is uttar pradesh sarkar, adhiwakta, nyay palika, mahamantri, skoda laura, adrak lsson. 


What is the obsession peeps.
Evidence: Finance: I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.

He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly.
Evidence: Fitness: A menu easy to cook/process - healthy and quick.
Evidence: Food: Same problem. I started eating power meals at home atleast saves me from crap quality. I even purchased a 250 per meal tiffin and it had palm oil!!!
Evidence: Travel: Never seen anything of this sort in capital city of India. So yes I did not expect 🤪

Writing Style: Casual / Humorous
Evidence: Haha Delhi is hateable too but mostly those are HR or UP14 NCR vehicle. Plus the percentage of vehicles of such sort is low.

Tone: Mostly Negative
